This project is a personal portfolio website created using React Js, React-bootstrap for styling, and Animate.css for animations. It was developed based on a tutorial from YouTube.

### Open Source Project

## Modifications and Firebase Integration

I have successfully completed the project by following a YouTube tutorial. However, there are a few modifications pending, specifically regarding the integration of a contact form using Firebase and Node.js.

### Help Needed

If you would like to contribute or provide assistance, I need help connecting the "Contact Us" form to Firebase using Node.js. Your support in implementing this feature would be greatly appreciated.

Feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or would like to collaborate on this improvement.

Thank you for your interest and potential contributions!

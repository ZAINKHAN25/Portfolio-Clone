This project is a personal portfolio website created using React Js, React-bootstrap for styling, and Animate.css for animations. It was developed based on a tutorial from YouTube.

### Open Source Project

## Modifications and Firebase Integration

I have successfully completed the project by following a YouTube tutorial. However, there are a few modifications pending, specifically regarding the integration of a contact form using Firebase and Node.js.
